# The Tidy Archive Catalogues project

The aim of the Tidy Archive Catalogue project is to provide code to create human- and computer-readable archivist catalogues. We want to create a python package which will:
 1. enable researchers to analyse and visualise at the level of a catalogue or a subset of the catalogue that they find interesting.
 2. make checking for mistakes in archiving (typos, or non-compliance with archiving standards) easy for archivists, who work quickly and make many subtle decisions.

<!-- TODO: This project grew out of the [Mapping Messel project](link), in which we [visualised](link) Oliver Messel's correspondence from [The Theatre Collection](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/theatre-collection/) at the University of Bristol.-->

## Website
The [project website](https://nataliethurlby.github.io/tidy-archive-catalogues/) has the latest information and documentation.

<!-- TODO: Include info about cataloguing guidelines.
This: https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/cat_guide_multi.pdf is the only open UK guidance I’ve seen for creation dates so far, but it’s from 2002, and it’s not too prescriptive (i.e. it suggests that it’s okay to use square brackets, c, or ?, but it doesn’t imply whether there is an order of preference, etc), so it makes sense that people would try different things.
